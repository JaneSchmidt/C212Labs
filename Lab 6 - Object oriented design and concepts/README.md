In lab 6 we learned how to use encapsulation, abstraction, and inheritance. We first created the Person class which is a parent class to Athlete, then we created the hockey, basketball, and soccer athelete classes which all inherit from the Athlete class. For the second part of the lab we created our own data structures using LinkedStringList and SimpleStringSet which both inherit from the StringCollection interface.
